## **Project Overview**

Diabetes affects millions worldwide, posing a significant public health challenge. Early detection and intervention are vital to managing this chronic metabolic disorder effectively. Research tells us that by the year 2030, in Kenya alone we expect that the total diabetes expenditure would be approximately KES 27.3 million, and that would increase to KES 42.5 million by the year 2045.  
Shocking.  
Diabetes, not only impacts at a national level, the impact of its magnitude can be felt at an individual level, as well as those that are close to the person.  
So why does it matter?  
As the *Sugar Control Squad*, we aren't just working on another data science project, but we believe that contributing to finding a solution to diabetes is a life-saving expedition. We aim to develop a predictive model to identify individuals that are at risk of developing diabetes. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and diverse datasets encompassing medical records, lifestyle factors, and demographic information.

## **Problem Statement**

The challenge at hand is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and diverse datasets, the model must find meaningful features that contribute to a person's diabetic status, with F1 score as the main success metric â€“ a crucial harmony of precision and recall, particularly relevant in medical cases.


## **Project Objectives**
The primary goal is to find meaningful inferences(features) which in turn will be used in identifying Diabetes in a person, the objectives of the project are therefore the following: <br> <br>
1. **Develop a High-Performing Predictive Model:** Create a robust predictive model with a high F1 score that accurately identifies individuals at risk of developing diabetes. The model will leverage advanced machine learning algorithms and diverse datasets encompassing medical records, lifestyle factors, and demographic information. Achieving a high F1 score ensures a balance between precision and recall, making it well-suited for medical applications.

2. **Uncover Key Factors in Diabetes Risk:** Conduct in-depth feature analysis to identify the most significant factors contributing to an individual's diabetic status. Understanding these key risk factors will provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals, enabling targeted interventions and personalized preventive measures.

3. **Empower Individuals for Proactive Health Management:** Empower individuals to take charge of their health by providing educational resources and personalized lifestyle recommendations based on their risk assessment results. By promoting proactive health management, the project aims to reduce diabetes risk factors and foster a healthier society.

### **Success Metrics**

In our pursuit of developing an accurate predictive model, we have carefully chosen the F1 score as our primary success metric. The F1 score strikes a perfect balance between precision and recall, making it particularly well-suited for medical applications. By prioritizing the F1 score, we ensure that our model excels in identifying both true positive cases and minimizing false negatives, crucial in the context of diabetes risk prediction. This choice aligns with best practices in medical research, guaranteeing that our project's success is measured against the most relevant and impactful metric.
## **Data Understanding**

The data for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) and consists of 253,680 rows and 22 columns. It includes valuable information collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey conducted annually by the CDC. The survey captures responses from over 400,000 Americans, providing insights into health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the utilization of preventive services.

# **Recommendations & Next Steps**

#### Increased Awareness/Education on Diabetes
Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, it is crucial to prioritize public awareness and education initiatives about the disease. By fostering a better understanding of the risk factors, prevention measures, and early symptoms, we can empower individuals to take proactive steps towards managing their health effectively.

#### Leveraging the Power of the Gradient Boost Model
The remarkable performance of the Gradient Boost model positions it as a powerful tool for healthcare providers and policymakers. Integrating this model into clinical practice can aid in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes promptly, facilitating timely interventions, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

#### Enhancing Data Collection and Model Performance
To further enhance the model's predictive capabilities, obtaining more localized and comprehensive data specific to the target population is essential. Collecting data that reflects regional and cultural variations will improve the model's accuracy and effectiveness, leading to more personalized and tailored healthcare solutions. Additionally, continuously updating the model with real-time data will ensure its relevance and applicability over time.

By implementing these recommendations and taking the necessary steps, we can make significant strides in combating diabetes and promoting a healthier society. The journey towards diabetes prevention and management requires collective efforts from healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the community at large.
